# EURO 2024 Match Outcome Prediction â€” by Dodevca

## About This Project
A machine learning project designed to predict match outcomes for the EURO 2024 tournament based on historical data and team statistics. This project leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and supervised learning models to analyze patterns and forecast match results.

## Tech Stack & Tools
| Category     | Stack                        |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| Data Analysis| Python (Pandas, NumPy)        |
| Machine Learning | Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) |
| Visualization | Matplotlib, Seaborn          |
| Environment  | Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook) |

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of football match datasets.
- Feature extraction focusing on team performance metrics.
- Implementation of machine learning classifiers to predict match outcomes.
- Visualization of prediction results and model evaluation metrics.
- Google Colab notebook for reproducible and shareable workflow.

## Live Demo (optional)
This project is designed to be run on Google Colab. You can open the notebook directly via:
[Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dodevca/euro-2024-prediction/blob/main/Big_Data_Final_Project.ipynb)

## Installation and Usage (Local Setup)
1. Clone this repository.
2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment if running locally.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
    # OR
    venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
    ```
3. Install project dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Open the notebook.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook euro_2024.ipynb
    ```
5. Run through the notebook to see the prediction workflow.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate more complex models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for higher prediction accuracy.
- Expand dataset with up-to-date match statistics closer to EURO 2024.
- Deploy a simple prediction app using Streamlit for public access.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
